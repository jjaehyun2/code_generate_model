"Problem: Optimal Path in a Dynamic Grid (Hard)
You are given a 2D grid of size N x M, where each cell contains a positive integer cost. You start at the top-left cell (0, 0) and want to reach the bottom-right cell (N-1, M-1).

At each step, you can move:

Right to cell (i, j+1)

Down to cell (i+1, j)

Diagonal to cell (i+1, j+1)

However, the cost of moving from cell A to cell B is not just the cost of B, but the maximum of the costs of A and B. Your task is to find the path from (0, 0) to (N-1, M-1) with the minimum total accumulated cost, where the accumulated cost is the sum of all movement costs along the path.

ðŸ§¾ Input
The first line contains two integers N and M (1 â‰¤ N, M â‰¤ 1000).

The next N lines each contain M integers representing the grid (1 â‰¤ grid[i][j] â‰¤ 10^4).

ðŸ–¨ Output
Print a single integer: the minimum total cost of a path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell under the given rules.

 Note
The optimal path in the example is:

(0,0)=1 â†’ (1,1)=8 â†’ (2,2)=3

Movement costs: max(1,8)=8, max(8,3)=8

Total movement cost = 8 + 8 = 16
But this is not optimal.

Better path:

(0,0)=1 â†’ (0,1)=2 â†’ (1,2)=2 â†’ (2,2)=3

Movement costs: max(1,2)=2, max(2,2)=2, max(2,3)=3 â†’ Total = 2+2+3 = 7
Plus initial cell cost 1 â†’ Final total = 1 + 7 = 8
